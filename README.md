# interator
Module for integer sequence generation and related conditional tests. Includes
generators for prime, composite, polygonal, Fibonacci, and Pell numbers. The
module is compatibile with other generalizations of these numbers, such as the
Tribonacci or Pellâ€“Lucas numbers. The project also includes conditional 
functions for testing integers for all of the sequences along with other tests,
such as the Miller-Rabin Primality Test.
