# interator
Module for integer sequence generation and related conditional tests. Includes
generators for prime, composite, polygonal, Fibonacci, and Pell numbers. The
module is compatible with other generalizations of these numbers, such as the
Tribonacci or Pellâ€“Lucas numbers. The project also includes conditional 
functions for testing integers for all of the sequences along with other tests,
such as the Miller-Rabin Primality Test. Lastly, the module includes 
nth_fibonacci, a function to calculate F(n) quickly without generating all of 
the proceeding values.
